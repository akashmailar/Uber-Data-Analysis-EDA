# Uber-Data-Analysis-EDA
This repository focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber trip data. The goal is to uncover key insights from the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis, and to help in understanding ride patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement in Uber's service.

## Overview:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in analyzing any dataset, where the goal is to summarize its main characteristics, often with the help of visual methods. This repository contains notebooks and scripts that perform EDA on a dataset of Uber trips.

## Requirements:
To get started with this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter notebooks (optional, for visual exploration)

## Analysis:
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:

- Handling missing data.
- Converting timestamps to readable formats.
- Filtering irrelevant or outlier data.

## Visualizations:
Visualizations help in understanding the dynamics of Uber trips and identifying patterns that could be useful for both customers and Uberâ€™s operational team.

## Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or fixes to suggest, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. When contributing, please ensure the code follows the style guidelines and is well documented.
